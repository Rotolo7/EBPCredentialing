# Step 1: Import the necessary libraries
import pandas as pd

# Step 2: Read the Excel file into a Pandas DataFrame
df = pd.read_excel('Original.xlsx')

# Step 3: Define the clinician names
names = ['Ana Reyes', 'Danielle DiLauro', 'Victoria Ortiz']

# Step 4: Define the discharge reasons
discharge_reason = [
    'Successfully completed selected EBP Model requirements – no more treatment needed',
    'Successfully completed selected EBP Model requirements – continue with other treatment'
]

# Step 5: Remove rows based on the conditions
df = df[~(
    df['Clinician'].isin(names) &
    (df['Status'] != 'Closed') &
    ~(df['discharge_reason'].isin(discharge_reason))
)]

# Step 6: Save the cleaned DataFrame back to an Excel file
df.to_excel('cleaned_file.xlsx', index=False)
